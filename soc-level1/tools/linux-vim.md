# Do you VIM it? 
Sometimes we don’t have the luxury of using a GUI text editor—especially on Linux servers. That’s why learning **Vim** is so important.

Sure, there are other tools like `nano`. But Vim was the first editor I was exposed to when learning how to code, so it’s the one I’m most comfortable with. Plus, let’s be honest—Vim is kind of awesome.

Here, I document everything I need to survive (and thrive) using Vim on Linux.


## In “Insert” mode:
- G → Jump to the last line
- gg → to first line
- 0 → to the start of a line
- $ → to the end of a line
- dd → delete the whole line
- E → jump forward to the end of a word

(Will continue adding, or feel free let me know some other tricks in the comment!)
