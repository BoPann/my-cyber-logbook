# Port Scan 
Port scanning provides a landscape of a network during the [reconnasissance](reconnasissance.md) phase. It reveals what services are running and what devices are present. Having unnecessary ports open increases the attack surface, which can then be exploited by an attacker. 

For SOC analysts, it’s important to:
1. Perform port scanning to understand the network landscape
2. Detect when someone else is scanning the network

In addition, an increase in traffic volume may be observed, which could cause users to report network slowness. This is something a help desk should keep in mind.
