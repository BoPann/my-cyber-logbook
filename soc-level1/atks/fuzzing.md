# Fuzzing
> This one doesn't work? Try this one!!!


## Overview
Throw anything you have to see how the target behaves

“Fuzzing is basically stress-testing software by throwing tons of random or messed-up inputs at it to see what breaks. It’s an automated way to catch bugs you’d probably never find on your own.”

### Description
**Fuzzing vs brute forcing**

Fuzzing would be like throwing everything you can find at the door - keys, screwdrivers, even a rubber duck - to see if anything unlocks it. Brute-forcing would be like trying every combination on a key ring until you find the one that opens the door.
