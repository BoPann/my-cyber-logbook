## Active vs Passive

1. **Active** - directive contact
	- social engineering 
	- port scanning
	- probbing
	- `when someone is actively scanning the network, the defender should be alerted. 
2. **Passive** - indirective contact
	- whois lookup 
	- social media scraping
	- reviewing breach data.
	- `There is not much the defenders can do about this, as the informaiton is public available.
