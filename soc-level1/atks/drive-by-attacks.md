## What is it?
A **drive-by attack** happens when simply visiting a compromised or malicious website automatically triggers malware download or execution **no clicking required**.

## Who's the target?
outdated browser and OS

## Siver Lining
Modern browsers + patched OS = drive-by attacks are very unlikely.

## Evolution
Attackers now rely on:

- Fake downloads
- Malvertising
- Rogue browser extensions
- Password manager popups
- HTML smuggling
