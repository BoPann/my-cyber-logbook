## AI in Cybersecurity

AI has a big role to play in cyberseucity. 

AI makes it easier for beginners to carry out advanced attacks that once required strong coding skills.\
We’re already seeing more effective attacks in areas like:

- weaponized phishing
- automated reconnaissance
- social engineering

On the other hand, defenders are also starting to adopt these tools for:

- anomalous behavior detection
- alert triage
- automated playbooks and response

It worries me, but also excites me, to see how this will play out. Who’s going to win this tug-of-war?
