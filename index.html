        <h3>1. Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          When I was training to be a pilot, every lesson ended with a ritual: my instructor and I would sit down and debrief. We would talk about what went well, what almost went well, and what absolutely did not go well. Then he’d sign my logbook with all the details including flight time, how many takeoffs and landings I didn’t mess up, how long we stayed in the air, which airports we bothered.
        </p>
        <p>
          That whole process helped me learn faster, stay accountable, and see progress, even on the days I felt like a confused pigeon in the sky. Writing these entries helps me keep track of what I’ve learned, connect the dots, and laugh at my own mistakes.
