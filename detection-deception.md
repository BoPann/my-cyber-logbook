# Deception with John Hammond Live
> Really glad I had the opportunity to join the live session with John Hammond on **Learn Cyber Deception**. It was especially cool to hear my question get a shout-out and answered live! I asked: "The domain seems pretty obvious. Would an attacker really fall for that trap?" Short answer: Yes :)

Attackers try to be sneaky.  
Defenders get sneaky on purpose.

## Overview
Once attackers land in a local environment, things get risky for them. Every move has to be careful, every step calculated. Meanwhile, the SOC only needs to catch them **once**.

That’s the beauty of defense.  
The attacker has to be right _every time_.  
The defender only has to be right _once_.

## Description
Can attackers spot a honeypot?  
Sometimes, yes.

But it’s like Jerry seeing a piece of cheese and suddenly freezing.  
Is it free food… or a trap waiting to ruin his day? 🧀😬
You see that mind game we are playing here? 

Tools like **Canarytokens**, **OpenCanary**, and services like **Tracebit** (great for catching info stealers) act like silent tripwires. Touch them once, and alarms go off.

Defense does not need to be perfect.  
It just needs to be _smart_

Tool Mentioned:

- https://tracebit.com/
> Fun tool! Will spend some time play around with them! More to come!

Some other notes:
- From a business perspective, most customers don’t really care _how_ you caught the attacker. They just want them **out of the system**.
- Small businesses shut down every year because of data breaches. Sometimes all it takes is one attacker, one mistake, and one system that was not ready.
