### HTA
Not long ago - in the summer of 2025 - researchers discovered that ransomware groups were using HTA files disguised as fake verification pages to spread the [Epsilon Red](https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/threat-actors-lure-victims-into-downloading-hta-files-using-clickfix-to-spread-epsilon-red-ransomware) ransomware.

Short for **HTML Application**, nn HTA file is like a small desktop app built using familiar web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a summary, the process for reviewing a suspicious HTA can be broken down into three main steps:

1. Identify the scripts section (VBScript)
2. Look for encoded data or external connections (e.g. Base64, HTTP requests)
3. Follow the logic to see what's execute or being sent out.
