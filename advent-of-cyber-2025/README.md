# Advent of Cyber
My journey saving the Christmas of Wareville!

This has been a fun journey with TryHackMe. I learned something new every day —sometimes a brand-new concept, sometimes realizing I _definitely_ didn’t know something as well as I thought I did. Overall, it was a great way to explore new cybersecurity topics while reinforcing the basics. Most importantly... Merry Soc-Mas!!!
