# Triage - Can this be more louder? (To be continued, server down)

## 1. Overview
Similar to how we handled the **SOC Workbook and Lookup**, what we’re doing here is triaging an alert in Microsoft Sentinel. The real question is: how should a SOC analyst actually work through an alert to make the right call? After all, it can be just noise or false positive. 

## 2. Description
### 2.1 alert triage 
> SOC can use these as metric to determin if an incident is serious

- severity  (how bad it is?)
- timestamp and frequency (how often is it?)
- atk stage/context (again, how bad is it really?? )
- affected assets (impact) (seriously, How bad is it ???)
