"Alright, everybody, listen up! Circle up. Conference room, five minutes. No, now!

Look, analyzing the network is like... it’s like a footprint. If a bad guy walks through your kitchen, he’s gonna leave a footprint. Unless he’s a ghost. Are we dealing with ghosts? Toby, shut up. We’re not dealing with ghosts.

The problem is, the network log is huge. It is massive. It’s like a giant, overwhelming pile of... of paper. It’s like the warehouse down there. If I go down to the warehouse and I say, 'Hey, find me the one invoice where someone bought a single paperclip,' Darryl is going to look at me and say, 'Michael, there are billions of papers here.'

And that is why our SOC analysts—our warriors, our heroes—need two things.

One: **Deep networking knowledge.** You need to know what a 'handshake' is. And I’m not talking about a 'firm grip, look 'em in the eye' handshake. I’m talking about computer stuff. If you don't know the basics, you're just a guy looking at a screen of green text like you're in _The Matrix_. And I am Neo. Obviously.

Two: **Advanced filtering techniques.** You have to find the 'intelligence' in the 'noise.' It’s like when Jan is talking. It’s just _noise, noise, noise, noise, noise_... and then she says, 'Michael, I’m going to the mall,' and I isolate that. That is actionable intelligence. I know she's gone for two hours. I can take a nap.

So, if you don't have the skills to find the bad guy in the big pile of logs, then you are basically just Toby. And nobody wants to be Toby.

**I declare... CYBERSECURITY!**"
