# Security Design Principles

5 Design Principles to secure a system according to ISO/IEC 19249:  
1. Least Privilege  
2. Attack Surface Minimization  
3. Centralized Parameter Validation - validate user's input  
4. Centralized General Security Services - centralize security service  
5. Prepare for Error and Exception Handling  
  
3 and 5 are perhaps the most relatable for software engineers. I remember my professor told me always try to think like a user - and that mindset really does go a long way.
