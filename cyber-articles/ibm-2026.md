# IBM Cybersecurity Prediction for 2026

My two takeaways:
- Malicious packages are getting more sophisticated, while the skill required to launch attacks is getting lower. On the flip side, defenders are also using AI to better predict, detect, and eradicate threats.

- Passkeys as a more secure, phishing‑resistant replacement for passwords. Large companies, including IBM, are deploying passkeys broadly (IBM requires them internally)

AI has a huge role to play in cybersecurity. I always feel we are still at the very early stage of it, which makes me feel scared and hopeful at the same time, if that makes sense.
