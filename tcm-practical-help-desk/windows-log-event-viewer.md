# Windows Log
## 1. Overview
The **Windows Log** is a centralized archive where the operating system and applications record significant actions, errors, and security events. Each record is called an **Event**. When things happen, this is the place to look. 

## 2. Description
- **Application:** Events logged by software applications (e.g., a program crash or successful database connection).
- **Security:** Events related to security auditing (e.g., successful/failed login attempts, file access/deletion).
- **System:** Events logged by Windows system components and drivers (e.g., driver failures, system startup/shutdown).
- **Setup:** Events related to Windows installation, updates, and domain controller changes.

## 3. Why it Matters?
- Event Log is like a record, it helps Help desk or SOC analyst to figure what's going on.
