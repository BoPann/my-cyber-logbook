# Windows Updates
## 1. Overview
There are few types of updates in windows 

## 2. Description
The Windows update model is based on a predictable monthly cycle (known as "Patch Tuesday") and the principle of **cumulativeness**.

- **1. Monthly Security Update Release (Patch Tuesday / "B" Week):**
    - **Mandatory** release on the **second Tuesday** of the month.
    - **Cumulative:** Contains all new **security fixes** plus all previously released security fixes and non-security fixes from the prior month's optional preview.
    - This is the primary way to keep Windows secure and up-to-date.

- **2. Optional Non-Security Preview Release ("D" Week):**
    - An **optional** release, typically available later in the month.
    - **Cumulative:** Contains only **non-security** fixes (bug fixes, stability improvements, minor feature additions) that will be included in the next month's mandatory "Patch Tuesday" update.
    - This release is intended for IT professionals to **preview and validate** non-security content before it becomes mandatory.
        
- **3. Out-of-Band (OOB) Release:**
    
    - Released **as needed** outside the regular monthly schedule.
    - Used to address a critical, high-impact issue, such as an actively exploited security vulnerability or a major stability bug introduced by a prior patch.

## 3. Why it Matters?
- Updates ensure the SOC Analyst spends less time dealing with preventable incidents and more time hunting for sophisticated threats.
