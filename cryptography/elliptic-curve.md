# Elliptic Curve

- **G = starting point**
- **Q = ending point**
- **k = number of steps + exact path taken*


You tell me:
- where you **started**
- where you **ended**

But you **never** tell me:
- how many steps you took
- which turns you made
- the entire path
    

And **figuring out that path is practically impossible** because:
- the “map” (the elliptic curve) is huge
- the steps aren’t straight lines
- each step depends on point doubling/addition rules
- backtracking has no efficient algorithm
